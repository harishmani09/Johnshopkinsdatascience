###Author -- Harish Mani

this is the final project for the course getting and cleaning data of by Jons Hopkins University. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability 
to collect rough data and clean data into tidy data set


###Repository Contents
The repository contains the following files
a) R script named as run_analysis.R
b) Codebook describing the process and the files with variables named as Codebook.md
c) a readme file named as README.md
d) Tidy data set named as TidyData.txt

#### Grading Review Criteria
1.The submitted data set is tidy. 
2.The Github repo contains the required scripts.
3.GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, 
    along with units, and any other relevant information.
4.The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
5.The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

## Project Objective 
####Getting and cleaning wearable Computing Data
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example 
this article .Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
